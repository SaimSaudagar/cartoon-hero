        <h2>About Sung Jinwoo</h2>
        <p>Sung Jinwoo is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, he
            got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability
            to grow in strength without restraint. As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him
            by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter and the second Shadow Monarch.
